## A. Introduction

![Overview](/img/overview.png)

### Problem

Long time ago, i was new in field of full stack developer. My stack is laravel react, i know little bit of laravel and react.

I don't know the best practice, and functions that react and laravel already have to do some logic.

The steps i use to learn something: learn few -> just do it -> improve (best practice etc)

**How about reading the documentation?**

The laravel and react, have a lot of features and helper functions. and ofcourse they make a lot documentations.

The problem is we have to read **a lot** of the documentation so we understand the best practice.

### Solutions 

#### Approach

1. The first solution is use chat gpt, copy the code you have made and ask chat gpt to modify it into best practice. this method you will be open and close chat gpt offer time. (it wasting time)

2. Using Template and Boilerplate. I also use paid template. (ensuring they maintain the dependencies update). How about boilerplate? many boilerplate is just opensource repo. that is not well maintenance. outdated dependencies, outdated integration method. etc ...

#### Finally

So i made this starter kit to ensure the the dependencies is maintened, integration is seamless, also the security, everthing just work, documented, and have system overview.

Maybe you are project manager that also want this thing, so you can easily explain to your team about your project and the tech stack do you use using our overview.

#### Conclusion

I will make solid laravel react starter kit with includes many amazing component.
